            <p>I made my Steam account in 2011, specifically to play Killing Floor with my friends.
Before that, I had no idea something like Steam could exist.
I was still living in the world of buying PC games at the store, especially Blizzard games.
Little did I know that Steam would become the primary way I buy and play video games ever since.
A big thank you to Valve for supporting Linux gaming.</p>
