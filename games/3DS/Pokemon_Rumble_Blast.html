    <p>
        Chapter 1 had some tough spots that left me repeatidly playing zones multiple times.
        There were a few Pokemon that had low spawn rates, which seems intentional.
        In one of the zones, I was having a hard time catching a Pidgeot.
        Usually, only one spawns every three attempts.
        What I ended up doing was evolving Pidgey into Pidgeotto, then those Pidgeotto into a Pidgeot. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Another rough spot was the baby Pokemon.
        Obviously, you can't evolve into those, so you'll need to grind for them.
        They have a low spawn rate, and it's harder to make them tip over because they have lower health.
        It took me about an hour to catch both Abra and Iggilybuff respectively. 
        I ended up getting a few of the legendaries before the trouble Pokemon listed above, so it wasn't a complete struggle.

        No new comments about Chapter 2, mostly the same comments I had about Chapter 1.
        Learning how the game plays and how the rest of the chapters will be.
        I strongly suggest checking to see if you can evolve into new Pokemon rather than farming them.
        Many hard to find Pokemon in this chapter can be evolved into.

        This chapter ended up being a lot shorter than I expected.
        I think I was luckier with my RNG this time, making it feel shorter.
        No legendaries this time around, so I'll have to come back and grind them at a later point.
    </p>
    <p>
        Chapter 3 did introduce something special, however.
        There's a secret hideout for Rotom that only opens every so often.
        Others online have said it's a random timeframe, but I wanted to see if I could figure out the actual time.
        After researching and testing a bit more, myself and others came to the anecdotal conclusion that loading new zones has a chance to open the hideout.

        Chapter 4 was short, but it took a while to complete.
        It brought back the mechanic from Chapter 3, where you had to befriend all the Pokémon in a hideout.
        This time, they chose Unown, which had 28 unique Pokémon to befriend instead of 6.
        Around 90% of my time in this chapter was attempting to get all the unown, which is very frustrating, and one of the few oversights I've seen in the design.

        Zone 2 was particularly difficult.
        The S+ had a very tight timer and strong Pokemon that couldn't be killed in one hit.
        All but one zone also had a legendary that would spawn randomly.
        The original legendary birds in particular felt like they had a low spawn and low drop chance, but I eventually pulled through.

        Once you get to this point in the game, it's going to test your resiliance.
        Up until now, I was enjoying every second of the game.
    </p>
        First off, any legendaries you didn't get while clearing all the zones, you now have to go back and get.
        This consists of you running through levels that have legendaries until they spawn.
        Hopefully, you saved a <strong>Speedy++</strong> Pokemon to run through the levels, then quickly port back to town.
    <p>
        Secondly, the streetpass legendaries are next to impossible unless you have 150 days to spare, live with someone else who has a modded 3DS, or somehow have friends who you meet up with regularly who also have a modded 3DS.
        If you don't have another 3DS to streetpass, it's 10 play coins to simulate a streetpass, which you can only get 10 of per day.
        Good luck.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lastly, the upper level challenges are insanely hard.
        They aren't just hard to get S+ rank on, they're hard to win at all.
        There's next to no Pokemon that are viable enough to come close to beating these challenges.
        The only way I could figure out how to come anywhere near beating them was to farm Giratina over and over again until I get one with insane stats.
        Giratina has the ability to go underground while attacking, thus dodging the enemy attacks and stuns.
        If you get stunned at all, you're instantly dead.
        If you get hit at all, that's a quarter or more of your health gone, usually getting one-hit-killed by the boss.
    </p>
    <p>
        I didn't mind grinding the legendaries in my first point.
        However, 150 streetpasses is insanely stupid, even at the peak of the 3DS, but this isn't the worst part.
        The end of the game doesn't feel like anyone was ever supposed to get to it.
