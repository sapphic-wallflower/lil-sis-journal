description: A list of PC games lil sis has attempted to complete.

I've been playing games on my computer my entire life.
I was given my first machine in 1996 and have been tinkering with them ever since.
Before I even touched a console, I was playing computer games such as Diablo, Might & Magic, Myst, StarCraft, and more.
PC gaming has and always will be my home, it has defined a lot of who I am to this day.

I'm currently running Fedora Linux using KDE Plasma and have been using Linux full time since July 2020.
