This has been a particularly difficult year.
Breaking up with a partner who seemed like a nesting partner, then moving away from two closest friends and a city that had finally started to feel like home—it dismantled an entire routine.
Being doxxed twice compounded everything.
While not the worst year on record, it sent my existing depression into overdrive.

Every year, I try to make a bingo card and see how much I can complete.
At the very least, I like to try to get a single bingo.
Things didn't work out in my favour this year, however.

Before I get into the list, most of these were for money reasons.
I wasn't able to find a job this year, and I would rather not spend any money on vanity projects, not knowing when I'll be able to regain my income.
Here's a list:

- Plant some flowers
- Get a tattoo
- Create a full new cosplay
- Fix my broken car light
- Use my Instax camera more
- Mod a Wii U

For these, I fully planned them out.
I knew how I was going to do it, and I still have all those plans.
Unfortunately, until I'm able to get a job, they're on the back burner for now.
Let's move on to the rest of the items.

### [Failed] Convert old PC to server
My current partner and I have similar hobbies when it comes to tech in the home.
As I was moving into her place, she was in the process of building a server from old parts.
She had this project in mind, but was just putting it off.
I needed a server before moving in, so she picked up her old project, making mine obsolete.
There's no reason to have two servers in the house, so I decided to sell my old PC instead of turning it into a server.

### [Failed] Lose 30 pounds (ca. 14 kg)
My body isn't the biggest fan of me.
Not counting working out, I can only consume around 1400 calories per day to lose one pound a week.
It's extremely difficult to eat that little calories.
I've talked to many nutritionists about this over the years, and they've come to the same conclusion that my genetics aren't good.
Even with consistent workouts, and healthier eating, it doesn't change.
I, unfortunately, ended up gaining five pounds this year instead of losing any.
This has been a lifelong goal for me, so I'll continue to press on.

### [Failed] Mod a Wii
After moving out of my last place, leaving all my friends behind, I've had fewer people over at my new place.
No one lives where I live, despite having three times the population.
My current partner has a modded Wii U, so the desire to mod a Wii, even for educational purposes, just wasn't there to motivate me to do it.

### [Failed] Reach next user class in RED
RED is a private tracker, and where I do all my music archival.
While I almost made it to the next user class, I severely underestimated how much effort it would take to get there.
From where I'm at, I would need to upload 150 GB of music.
I mostly focus on ripping CDs, which are around 200 to 400 MB.
That would be around 400 CDs, which I would need to source, buy, rip (which takes about 30 minutes each), tag with metadata, and upload.
I do also upload some web content, which is much easier, but I'd need to find niche artists that people haven't already gotten to.
I am very passionate about music archival, but that amount is a massive undertaking.

### [Failed] Listen to 10 new full discographies
I don't have much personal space in the apartment I moved into with my partner.
It makes it harder to enjoy music in a capacity that allows me to focus.
Because it's a one bedroom, we're typically sharing the same room together.
When I listen to music, it's usually on the TV, of an album she chooses.
Not having a desk of my own and using the coffee table as my workstation, it makes it hard to not just focus on music, but really, doing much of anything.

### [Failed] Complete all the Pikmin games
Depression is probably my only answer here.
It was difficult to pick up my Switch.
It was difficult to pick up anything.
I'd still love to do this, and I hope I'm able to in the new year.

### [Passed] Ride my bike more
Until this year, I didn't even have a bike.
I was able to secure one for a cheap price of $150.
Since I bought it, I've attempted to ride it once a week at minimum, often to get groceries.
It's been working out really well.
I plan to ramp it up a lot more next year.

### [Passed] Dye my fur another colour
I've done this a thousand times, it's not that difficult to do.
When I made my bingo card last year, I was in a mood.

### [Passed] Switch to a new Linux distro & finish building my PC
Back in 2023, I started buying new parts for a computer as they went on sale.
I ended up buying everything except for the GPU.
I was waiting for GPUs to go on sale when I lost my job, and haven't been able to buy one since.
Instead, I decided to build the computer with what I have, and started fresh on a new Linux distribution.
I started with Nobara, and then switched to Fedora when I realized Nobara didn't support my old GPU from my old PC.
I'm happy with Fedora for now, and I have no plans to switch back to Nobara when I get a new GPU.

### [Failed] Finish Homestuck
This is something that I had planned to do with my ex-partner.
We aren't together anymore, and it hurts still to even think about finishing this on my own.

### [Failed] Complete all Minecraft advancements
I'll have a lot more to say about this when I'm done with it, but I don't have an excuse as to why I didn't finish it this year.
Depression has been distressing, combined with vanilla Minecraft not being very fun.
It was difficult to find the motivation to launch the game.

### [Failed] Get intermediate 10 in Pump It Up
Pump It Up is both very physically demanding, and the quality of play depends on the location you play at.
I have over 3000 songs played at the arcade I played at before having to move due to the breakup.
This breakup not only broke up the routine I had, but put a complete halt to my enjoyment of the game.
I moved to a place in Canada where people don't really have fun or enjoy themselves.
It's a region engulfed in hustle culture.
I tried to get the arcade to get the Pump It Up machine in good quality, but the employees there don't care.
They're underpaid teenagers who have a turnover of three months.
It's very challenging to play well on this machine.
My depression, plus the breakup, plus being away from the place I called home made it impossible to muster any motivation to keep pushing higher levels.

### [Failed] Watch 20 films
I don't know why this one was so hard for me.
My partner uses the TV a lot of the time, since she's not on her computer much anymore, so maybe that's why?
I definitely did watch some films since moving in, but perhaps it's just the depression? 
I don't know. :[

### [Failed] Find a new job
Either I'm not trying hard enough, or no one wants to hire me.
I don't know what's going on here.
Probably both.
I've submitted 500 applications this year, by the way.

### [Failed] Cook 5 new recipes
As I get closer to the end of the list, I'm realizing a breakup-fuelled depressive episode has led me to wasting an entire year out of my 80, 90, 100 some odd years of my life.
I guess that's the way it goes.
Perhaps 2026 will be better.

### [Failed] Sort my entire music collection
I have way more music than I thought.
Some of them are really difficult to source, or would require me to be the first person ever to document them.
I got a lot done, I just wasn't able to finish the whole collection.
Switching to a new self-hosted music player, Navidrome, helped, but wasn't enough to get the entire job done.

## Looking Forward: 2026

Hopefully, the goals set are more attainable and don't involve spending money.
Finding work doesn't look like it's going to get much easier, and I may need to settle for something less than I'm used to.

I made this bingo card design all on my own. :D
Thanks for taking the time to read, and wish me luck in 2026!
